# TODO List

Items left to do before this can be used for production installers:

* Pass icon to jpackage - done on Mac, need to do it on Win
* Should blocklist.txt be overwritten on router upgrades?
* Decide on jvm switches (i.e. -Xmx) and pass them through jpackage

To get some of these done OS detection may need to happen inside `build.sh`.
